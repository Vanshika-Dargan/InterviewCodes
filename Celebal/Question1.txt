A farm is being attacked by parasites. Due to this, the profit at which the plants are sold reduces by 50% at the end of each day.

You are given an array named profit[] of size N denoting the profit that each plant earns if it is sold on the first day itself. You are allowed to sell exactly one plant in a day and you want to maximise the total profit earned. To analyse the profit earned, you are given an array named query[] having Q queries.

For all Q queries, your task is to return the number of ways in which you can sell the plants such that the profit generated by selling all the plants is greater than or equal to query()

Eg. The profit[] array is (10.3) having 2 plants and the query!] array is {10}

having 1 query Here, there are two possible ways of selling plants the plants can be sold either in the order (plant 1 on day 1 and plant 2 on day 2) or (plant 2 on day 1 and plant 1 on day 2). Therefore, the profits will be 10+(3/2) (if the profit on a given day is a decimal number, only the integer part has to be considered) and 3+(10/2) respectively. So, we can achieve a profit greater than or equal to 10 in only 1 way

Note: If the profit is a decimal number only the integer part has to be considered.

input1: An integer array denoting profit J.

input2: An integer denoting the length of the array profit[] input3: An integer array denoting query J.

input4: An integer denoting the length of the array query]

Output Specification:

An array of Q integers denoting the number of ways in which you can sell the plants.

Example 1:

input1: (12,5)

input2: 2

input3: (10,15)

input4:2

Output: (2,0)

Explanation:

There are 2 ways of selling plants:

Way 1: The plants can be sold in the order: (plant 1, plant 2) so the profit 12-(5/2) = 12+2 = 14. =

â€¢ Way 2: The plants can be sold in the order: (plant 2, plant 1) so the

profit = 5+(12/2) = 5+6 = 11.

From the above, we see that we can achieve a profit of greater than or equal to 10 in 2 ways (Way 1 and Way 2) and a profit of greater than or equal to 15 in 0 ways.

Therefore, the answer is {2, 0}
